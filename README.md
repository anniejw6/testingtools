testingtools
================

This is an extremely basic package to randomize and analyze simple experiments,
largely for my personal use.

The code to randomize and estimate marginal effects has unit tests written. For everything else, take a look at the code to make sure you understand what it's doing.

# Install

```r
devtools::install_github('anniejw6/testingtools')
```
